      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </header>
    <p class="my-class">
      When the page opens, you are greeted with floating images. There's a stage
      in the middle that takes up most of the space and that is what first
      caught my attention. As I interacted with it, I was drawn into its subtle
      movement when the mouse hovers over the webpage.

      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </header>
    <p>list</p>

      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </header>
    <p>
      Because I was intrigued by the mouse causing objects to move, I spent the
      most time clicking on objects to see where it redirects me and what
      appears. I went back and forth between pages and simply hovering my mouse
      to see if there is any correlation between the movements and exploring
      content is in the webpage.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </header>
    <p>Mouse movement based interactions and page redirection</p>

    <header class="my-class1">
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </header>
    <p>
      Its an interaction base website that encourages users to be creative, and
      explore the website. Bringing “coding life” to the real world for new and
      innovative brands
    </p>

    <header class="my-class1">
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </header>
    <p>
      Its focused on “next gen” and that is correlated to the unusual and
      interactive/fun layout of the website. With 3D assets, floating motions
      and exploration based interactions. This enhances the experience
      encouraging creative thinking when navigating the website and shows that
      its talents are creative, innovative and iconic.
