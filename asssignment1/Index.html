      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?
    </header>
    <p class="my-class">
      When the page opens, you are greeted with floating images. There's a stage
      in the middle that takes up most of the space and that is what first
      caught my attention. As I interacted with it, I was drawn into its subtle
      movement when the mouse hovers over the webpage.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </header>
    <p>list</p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </header>
    <p>
      Because I was intrigued by the mouse causing objects to move, I spent the
      most time clicking on objects to see where it redirects me and what
      appears. I went back and forth between pages and simply hovering my mouse
      to see if there is any correlation between the movements and exploring
      content is in the webpage.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </header>
    <p>Mouse movement based interactions and page redirection</p>

    <header class="my-class1">
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </header>
    <p>
      Its an interaction base website that encourages users to be creative, and
      explore the website. Bringing “coding life” to the real world for new and
      innovative brands
    </p>

    <header class="my-class1">
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </header>
    <p>
      Its focused on “next gen” and that is correlated to the unusual and
      interactive/fun layout of the website. With 3D assets, floating motions
      and exploration based interactions. This enhances the experience
      encouraging creative thinking when navigating the website and shows that
      its talents are creative, innovative and iconic.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </header>
    <p>
      The experience could be interacted with over a short period of time. There
      are mainly three pages. Which is the main page, app pages, and the talents
      page. Users can explore this page within a couple of minutes but this
      could vary depending on how much users choose to experiment with the
      interactions
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </header>
    <p>
      Using 3D assets and minimal text. The layout of the website and its
      contents has minimal text, focusing on visuals and movement. This can
      reflect how it encourages users to navigate the website with a creative
      mind and continuous exploration
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </header>
    <p>Mainly 3D modelling and UX design. Potentially colour understanding</p>

    <header class="my-class1">
      10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </header>
    <p>
      I think to not assume what the intention of the website is and jump to
      conclusions. I almost didn't choose this website as the complicated
      navigation made me slightly not bothered to go further as I assumed it
      would be hard to understand the content and intention.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
      feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </header>
    <p>To be open minded and less harsh on the websites layout</p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </header>
    <p>
      I think its the loading time between each refresh and redirection. I
      appreciate that its part of the experience but I dont have the patience
      for it.
    </p>
    <header class="my-class1">
      13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?
    </header>
    <p>
      I guess that I have control over the website. How it moves is based on my
      mouse and it is satisfying to create the patterns and movement myself. As
      well as the colour coordination and pallet.
