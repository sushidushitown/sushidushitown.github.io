      1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience?

    <p>
      When the page opens, you are greeted with floating images. There's a stage
      in the middle that takes up most of the space and that is what first
      caught my attention. As I interacted with it, I was drawn into its subtle
      movement when the mouse hovers over the webpage.

      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.

      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </header>
    <p>
      Because I was intrigued by the mouse causing objects to move, I spent the
      most time clicking on objects to see where it redirects me and what
      appears. I went back and forth between pages and simply hovering my mouse
      to see if there is any correlation between the movements and exploring
      content is in the webpage.
